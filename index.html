     <P>About me:
        As a highly motivated and results-driven individual, I am passionate about delivering exceptional work and
        exceeding expectations. With a strong background in community development, I have developed a keen eye for
        detail and a deep understanding of accounting and costing. My experience working in community based
        organisations such as Drawing Dreams initiatives and Youth Empowerment development programs has equipped
        me with the ability to effectively communicate, collaborate, and problem-solve with individuals at all levels of an
        organization.I am a proactive learner who is always seeking to expand my skillset and knowledge base. I am
        proficient with ms excel spreadsheet ,PowerPoint presentations and have experience with analysing and
        presentation of data. </P>
